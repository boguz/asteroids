## 🚀 Why?

Growing up "Asteroids" and "Blasteroids" were some of my favourite games.

I have spent hours and hours playing them on my Spectrum 128K computer, and I was always thought it was really cool how such simple games could be so much fun to play.

## 🎮 How to play
- [Play it here](https://boguz.github.io/asteroids/)
